# Base-code
Welcome to the Base-code (C++ Data Structures Library repository), a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structure implementations in C++. These robust and efficient data structures are designed to empower developers with the tools needed to build high-performance applications.

# Included Data Structures:
1. Array and String Operations: Efficient implementations of basic array and string operations.
2. Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists with a range of operations for seamless integration.
3. Stacks and Queues: LIFO and FIFO data structures to manage data with precision.
4. Trees and Graphs: Binary trees, AVL trees, and graph representations with advanced traversal algorithms.
5. Hash Tables: Hash table implementation for optimal key-value pair storage.
6. Heaps: Binary heap implementation with the heap sort algorithm for sorting elements efficiently.
7. Trie: Trie data structure for lightning-fast string searches.
8. Disjoint Set (Union-Find): Implementation for efficient disjoint set operations.

# How to Use:
Each data structure has its own directory containing well-documented C++ code and README files that provide insights into usage. Feel free to explore, learn, and incorporate these data structures into your projects.

# Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, optimizations, or want to add new data structures, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
